RYCAL is customizable calendar software that auto-allocates time and is based on the concept of Day Types for agenda planning. This idea will develop over time, and is due to my family's obvious need for highly programmable agenda planning software. It will be free, open-source software, and APIs with documentation will be created to allow others to benefit. 

Due to Day Type design, it seems it will lend itself well to an object-oriented approach. I will use python for the original classes because I enjoy coding in python.
